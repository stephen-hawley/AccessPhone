# AccessPhone

My daughter has physical and cognitive issues that make it near impossible for her to use
any phone that is available on the market. This project is an attempt to solve the big
picture question "how can I make a phone useable and useful to my daughter?"

There are two types of phone available on the market today: flip phones and smart phones.
Both of those present issues. Since the deficiencies in smart phones can be corrected via
software, this is the obvious target that we should take.
